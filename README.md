Node Cassandra Template
=============
This is just my personal setup for NodeJS and Cassandra. I may add other useful things in here as a basis for a framework
but the idea is for this to be as simple as possible.

Requirements:

- NodeJS
- Cassandra v2.0.2
- Helenus (npm install helenus)

I've adapted some of the code from http://danialk.github.io/blog/2013/01/23/simple-node-server/

TODO:
- Create DB abstraction layer
- Add liquid support: npm install liquid
- Add CRUD to test.js
- Add support for site.json
